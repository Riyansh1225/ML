Pandas is high performance ans easy-to-use data structure.
This is mainly useful for data cleaning and analysis.
Pandas library use the most of the functionalities of the Numpy. Numpy is mandatory to understand the Pandas.
Pandas word derived from the Panel data- an Econometrics from Multidimensional data.
Using Pandas, we can accomplish five typical steps of the preprocessing of the data. 
1. Load
2. Prepare
3. manipulate
4. model 
5. Analyze

Uses of Pandas in Python ::

1. Python become strong script in data analysis because of Pandas.
2. Fast and effective Dataframe object with default and customized indexing.
3. Tools for loading data into in-memory data objects from different file formates.
4. Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
5. Reshaping and pivoting of data sets.
6. Lable-base slicing , indexing and subsetting of large data sets.
7. Columns fron data structre can be deleted or inserted.
8. Group by data for aggregation and transformation.
9. High performance merging and joining of data.
10. Time series functionlaity.

Pandas deal with below three data structure.

1. Series 
2. DataFrame 
3. Panel

These data structure are build on top of the Numpy array, which means they are fast.

Mutable ---> A mutable object can be changed after creating the objct. Means contensts can be changed.
           Eg :: int , float , bool , tuple etc.
Immutable ---> An immutable object cannot be changed once its created. Eg : list , set , dict etc..

--> All Pandas data structure are value mutable ( can be changed ) and except series all are size mutable. Series is size immutable.

--> Data Frames are mostly used data structure in Pandas. Panel is used less.

Below is some properties for data structure of Pandas.

1. Series 

  a. Homogeneous data
  b. Size Immutable
  c. Values of Data mutable
  
2. Data Frame 

  a. Heterogeneous data
  b. Size Mutable
  c. Data Mutable 
  
3. Panel 

  a. Heterogeneous data
  b. Size Mutable
  c. Data Mutable
